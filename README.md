### :open_book: Plot

Little Boy has just lost his precious kitten. He is on his way to bring her home. The journey he sets out isn't always easy. There are various obstacles that can slow him down. Don't let him down, help him overcome all the challenges so that he can finally see his friend again. 

### :joystick: Tutorial

As soon as the game begins, Little Boy will move at a constant speed. When reaching the screen's edges or barriers, he'll instantly change his direction.

Do not touch the traps, or the character would injure badly. You'll have to start the level again if you want to pass. Use your mouse and brain to change the order of six puzzles, thus changing your path so that you can reach the destination.
